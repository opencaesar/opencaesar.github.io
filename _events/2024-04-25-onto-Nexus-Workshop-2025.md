## About onto:Nexus Workshop

The <b>onto:Nexus Workshop</b>, or the International Workshop on Ontological Modeling and Analysis, is a forum for developers, researchers, and practioners to discuss topics related to the application of formal methods (adding rigor), DevOps methods (adding agilility), and AI methods (adding intelligence) to the practice of ontological modeling and analysis. It also intends to foster collaboration relationships within this community.

## This Edition

The <b>onto:Nexus Workshop 2025</b> is the 2nd edition of the workshop and has the theme of <b>Collaborations and Demonstrations</b>. This is where we like to see reports on recent collaborations between community members inspired by last year's call for collaboration. We also like to get presentations of new tools, capabilities, and exemplars that demonstrate rigor, agility, and/or intelligence in ontological modeling. Please check out the call for presentation below.

The workshop will be a <b>free one day hybrid event</b> that takes place at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ([JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/)) in Pasadena, CA, around the end of January 2025.

## Organizing Committee

* [Maged Elaasar](mailto:elaasar@jpl.nasa.gov), JPL, chair

## Call for Presentations

This year's call for presentation is open to members of the community to report on practice or research activities related to ontological modeling and analysis. Presentations can be about any relevant R&D work but priority will be given to presentations reporting on:

- Collaborative activities between community members
- New tools and capabilities
- Exemplar projects

Note: An exemplar needs to be hosted on a public Github repo. It should have a README.md file with instructions on how to run the examplar. Ideally, it should also have a Github Actions workflow that specifies how the example runs.
