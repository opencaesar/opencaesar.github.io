## About onto:Nexus Workshop

The <b>onto:Nexus Workshop</b>, or the International Workshop on Ontological Modeling and Analysis, is a forum for developers, researchers, and practioners to discuss topics related to the application of formal methods (adding rigor), DevOps methods (adding agilility), and AI methods (adding intelligence) to the practice of ontological modeling and analysis. It also intends to foster collaborations within this community.

## This Edition

The <b>onto:Nexus Workshop 2025</b> is the 2nd edition of the International Workshop on Ontological Modeling and Analysis. The theme of this edition is "Realizing the [RAISE](https://www.opencaesar.io/raise) Vision", where we will hear from members of the community about their efforts adding rigor, agility, and intelligence to their systems engineering practices. We will also hear about new and on-going collaborations inspired by the first edition of the workshop. Moreover, we will have tutorials featuring approaches, tools and/or case studies that exemply the RAISE vision.

The workshop will be a <b>free two-days hybrid event</b> that will take place at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ([JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/)) in Pasadena, CA, on January 29-30, 2025, and online in a Microsoft Teams meeting.

## Online Attendance

Only those who register will be invited to the Microsoft Teams meeting. The deadline for this is January 27, 2025.

## In-Person Attendance

There will be a logistical on-boarding process to go through to gain access to the venue. The deadline for this is January 15, 2025 if you are a US person, and January 1, 2025 if you are a foreign national.

## Call for Presentations

This edition's call for presentation is open to members of the community to report on practice or R&D activities related to ontological modeling and analysis. Presentations can be about any relevant work but priority will be given to presentations reporting on collaborations between community members.

Please send your proposal abstract by email to the chair of the workshop. We will follow up with you after that.

## Call for Tutorials

This year will feature tutorials on tools, technologies, and case studies supporting the RAISE vision. We are looking for proposals for half-day (3h) tutorials.

Please send your tutorial abstract by email to the chair of the workshop. We will follow up with you after that.

## onto:Nexus Forum

If you are not yet a member of the [onto:Nexus Forum](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/14235207/) (LinkedIn group), we invite you to join to be part of the community going forward.
