## About

The JPL Digital Engineering Center (JDEC) is hosting the **MBSE@JPL Workshop**, a specialized two-day event strategically scheduled immediately following the INCOSE International Workshop 2026 in Torrance, CA (January 31–February 3), making it convenient for attendees to participate in both events. The workshop offers a unique opportunity to explore cutting-edge innovations in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) directly from a prominent leader in systems engineering and one of the world's most innovative R&D centers.

Participants will gain firsthand insights into how JDEC is advancing MBSE methodologies and tools while creating impact for both internal and external partners. Attendees will network and engage in technical discussions with the JDEC team, and explore potential partnerships to implement these advances within their own organizational contexts.

JDEC's expertise spans multiple areas of MBSE technology across its various R&D labs. The program for this exclusive event will evolve based on the expressed interests of invited attendees, featuring a mix of presentations and discussion panels by JDEC staff and participants. There will also be opportunities for one-on-one conversations with JDEC about potential partnerships.

Space is limited and access to the JPL campus requires an onboarding process that takes several days (or weeks for foreign nationals) in advance. Interested attendees should contact [Dr. Maged Elaasar](mailto:elaasar@jpl.nasa.gov) as soon as possible for an invitation.
