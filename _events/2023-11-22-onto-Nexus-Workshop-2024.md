## Hybrid Event

<b>onto:Nexus Workshop 2024</b> is the 1st version of the workshop on <b>Ontological Modeling and Analysis</b>. The theme of this version is <b>Infusing Rigor and Agility in MBSE</b>. It will discuss what has been accomplished so far, what is being worked on currently, and what the future challenges and directions are. It also intends to build a community of practitioners in this area and foster collaborations among them.

The workshop is a free hybrid event that will take place on <b>Wed Jan 31st, 2024 from 8:30am to 5:00 pm PST</b> at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ([JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/)) in Pasadena, CA. This is the day after the [INCOSE IW 2024](https://www.incose.org/IW2024), which will take place on Jan 27-30 in (the nearby city of) Torrance, CA.

> A talk that introduces onto:Nexus Workshop 2024 and its theme will be given by [Maged Elaasar](mailto:elaasar@jpl.nasa.gov) as part of INCOSE IW 2024 agenda and is currently scheduled on Sat Jan 27, 2024 at 3:30 pm. [A Link will be provided soon].

## Pre-Event Questionnaire

A link to a pre-event questionnaire will be avialable soon. It will include questions that are meant to poll the community for their experiences, interests, and expectations. A summary of the answers will be presented in the introductory talk of the workshop.

## Call for Short Presentations

One of the main objectives of the workshop is to build a community for rigorous and agile MBSE. This is why the agenda includes a 1h 30m session for members of the community to present their context, interests, and plans. Since we want to accomodate as many such presentations as possible, they have to be short (10 mins) so we recommend 2-3 slides only. 

If you like to contribute a short presentation in this slot, we ask you to [send us](mailto:elaasar@jpl.nasa.gov) a short abstract and wait for a confirmation. You can then send the slides, which will be merged into a single deck to minimize the hand off time between presenters. The deadline is Jan 26, 2024.

## Call for Virtual Posters

The workshop will feature virtual posters contributed by members of the community. Those posters will consist of videos that showcases past or future work accompanied by a title and short description. The poster will be accessible publicly on the workshop's page (this page).

If you like to contribute a virtual poster, we ask you to [send us](mailto:elaasar@jpl.nasa.gov) your contribution. The deadline is Jan 26, 2024.

## Panel

The agenda includes a 1h panel session that will discuss how the community should collaborate to achive synnergy and move faster in this field. Questions will be posed on what to collaborate on and how to get organized to achieve them.

## JPL Campus Tour

The agenda has a 45 mins slot for a JPL campus tour for in-person attendees. (We will try to have a concurrent virtual tour for online attendees.)

## Breaks

A few breaks are planned in the agenda. Coffee will be provided by JPL. However, lunch will be the responsibility of attendees (can be brought or purchased from the JPL cafeteria during lunch break).

## onto:Nexus Forum

If you are not yet a member of the [onto:Nexus Forum](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/14235207/) (LinkedIn group), we invite you to join to be part of the community going forward.
