## Hybrid Workshop

<b>onto:Nexus Workshop 2024</b> is the 1st version of the workshop on <b>Ontological Modeling and Analysis</b>. The theme of this version is <b>Infusing Rigor and Agility in MBSE</b>. It will discuss what has been accomplished so far, what is being worked on currently, and what the future challenges and directions are. It also intends to build a community of practitioners in this area and foster collaborations among them.

The workshop is a free hybrid event that will take place on <b>Wed Jan 31st, 2024 from 8:30 am to 5:00 pm PST</b> at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ([JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/)) in Pasadena, CA. This is the day after the [INCOSE IW 2024](https://www.incose.org/IW2024), which will take place on Jan 27-30 in (the nearby city of) Torrance, CA.

## Workshop Chair

* [Maged Elaasar](mailto:elaasar@jpl.nasa.gov), JPL

> A [talk](https://event.conflr.com/IW2024/sessiondetail_404272) that introduces onto:Nexus Workshop 2024 and its theme will be given by Maged Elaasar as part of INCOSE IW 2024 agenda and is currently scheduled on Sat Jan 27, 2024 at 3:30 pm.

## Physical Venue

The physical venue will be room <b>180-101 at the JPL campus located at [4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109](https://maps.app.goo.gl/F8tbA4cT21b94vJJ9)</b>. Registration is required by [contacting us](mailto:elaasar@jpl.nasa.gov) and waiting for a confirmation. The deadline for this is Dec 20, 2023.

Notice that the venue space is limited and there will be time required to complete an onboarding process for JPL visitors. So the sooner you register, the better.

<u>Directions</u>: On the day of the event, please plan to arrive to the address above early (before 7:30 am). As you approach the enterance, mention that you are attending the event to the security personnel, then turn left and proceed to the JPL Badging Office. If you will be driving, you will need to park your vehicle in the visitor parking across (another reason to arrive as this may take time). Park there then walk back to the Badgging Office where you will need to check-in and get a visitor tag. As there will be many visitors trying to do the same process, this may take time. We need to finish this process by 8:15 am max then walk together as a group to the venue inside the JPL campus.

## Virtual Venue

The virtual venue will be a <b>Teams meeting</b>. Registration is required by [contacting us](mailto:elaasar@jpl.nasa.gov) and waiting for an invitation. The deadline for this is Jan 30, 2024.

## Pre-Event Questionnaire

We have created a [pre-event questionnaire](https://forms.gle/xcvj8ukLngLN31xYA) for you to fill out. It has four sections: a) Gett to Know you, b) MBSE in Practice (optional), c) Panel: How should we collaborate? (optional) and d) Questions from the organizers. The questionnaire is anonymous and a summary of the answers will be presented in the introduction to the workshop. We highly encourage you to fill out the questionnaire as a contribution (even if you do not plan to attend). We will also keep it open after the event, publish the summary online, and update it frequently. It will help define the community's R&D agenda going forward.

## Call for Short Presentations

One of the main objectives of the workshop is to build a community for rigorous and agile MBSE. This is why the agenda includes a 1h 30m session for members of the community to present their context, interests, and plans. Since we want to accomodate as many such presentations as possible, they have to be short (10 mins) so we recommend 2-3 slides only. 

If you like to contribute a short presentation in this slot, we ask you to [send us](mailto:elaasar@jpl.nasa.gov) a short abstract and wait for a confirmation. You can then send the slides, which will be merged into a single deck to minimize the hand off time between presenters. The deadline is Jan 26, 2024.

## Call for Virtual Posters

The workshop will feature virtual posters contributed by members of the community. Those posters will consist of videos/slides that showcases past or future work accompanied by a title and short description. The poster will be accessible publicly on the workshop's page (this page).

If you like to contribute a virtual poster, we ask you to [send us](mailto:elaasar@jpl.nasa.gov) your contribution. The deadline is Jan 26, 2024.

## Panel

The agenda includes a 1h panel session that will discuss how the community should collaborate to achive synnergy and move faster in this field. Questions will be posed on what to collaborate on and how to get organized to achieve them.

## JPL Campus Tour

The agenda has a 45 mins slot for a JPL campus tour for in-person attendees. (We will try to have a concurrent virtual tour for online attendees.)

## Breaks

A few breaks are planned in the agenda. Some coffee/tea will be provided by JPL. However, other food/drinks can be brought with you or purchased from the JPL cafeteria during breaks.

## onto:Nexus Forum

If you are not yet a member of the [onto:Nexus Forum](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/14235207/) (LinkedIn group), we invite you to join to be part of the community going forward.
