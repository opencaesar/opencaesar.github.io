## Project Summary

This project intends to develop an [OML](https://www.opencaesar.io/oml/)(Ontological Modeling Language) adapter (a bidirectional transformation) for the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) client. Such adapter will allow Obsidian to be used as an alternative ontological modeling and analysis workbench. This is desirable due to Obsidian's nice core features and its large ecosystem of community extensions, all of which would allow methodologists the ability to setup their tools easily.

A new ontological systems engineering method called 'Sierra' will be defined and tooled in this environment as a demonstration. A new system model example called 'Trail Power' will be defined in this environment and used to collect user feedback.

## Results

- This is the openCAESAR repo of the [Obsidian adapter](https://github.com/opencaesar/obsidian-adapter) on Github.
- This is the openCAESAR repo of the [example](https://github.com/opencaesar/trailpower-example)  on Github.

> This is still work in progress
