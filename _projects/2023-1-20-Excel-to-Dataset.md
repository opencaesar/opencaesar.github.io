## Project Summary

Microsoft Excel, which is used by a lot of engineers around the world, can be used as a sort of dataset, albeit a lightweight one. This is because each Excel sheet can essentially be thought of as a data table where rows represent objects and columns represent their attributes. The problem that arises (and the reason why an excel-to-dataset interface is needed) is that it is hard for users to write queries on the structured data in an Excel sheet directly. As such, we will create a web application that will allow a user to export an Excel sheet from a database based on a specified mapping, edit the sheet, then reimport it based on the same mapping to change the dataset. We use datasets expressed in the RDF format and hosted by the Fuseki server. We will query the dataset using SPARQL.
