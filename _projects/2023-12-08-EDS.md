## Summary

This project intends to develop an ontological representation of [SysML v2](https://www.omg.org/spec/SysML/20230201/SysML.xmi) in [OML](http://www.opencaesar.io/oml/). First, an OML vocabulary equivalent to the MOF-based metamodel of SysML v2 will be generated using a MOF2OML adapter. Second, another OML vocabulary that extends the first will be be (manually) developed to add the missing DL semantics (by setting flags and specifying rules) that are expressed in the specification but not encoded in the metamodel. Third, an OML vocabulary bundle will be developed to add disjointness axioms to the SysML v2 vocabulary. Fourth, some example SysML v2 models (from the SysML v2 working group) will be converted to OML descriptions conforming to the SysML v2 vocabulary. Fifth, some tools from [openCAESAR](https://www.opencaesar.io/) will be used to analyze and report on those models.
