## Summary

With the increased prevalence of large-scale software projects in all industries, UML diagrams allow architects to condense the complex repository to a readable visual representation, especially to smoothly transition new developers into their responsibilities. Outside of the internal network, these diagrams serve a great purpose to describe highly complex technology stacks to customers and stakeholders who are unfamiliar with programming technologies. 

Although UML diagram making software already exists, projects teams are hesitant to invest an engineerâ€™s valuable time to the creation of these diagrams, as drawing or generating them is a timely, tedious process that also may contain errors. Additionally, not everyone has the knowledge to create accurate UML diagrams, hindering their ability to get an organized visual to kickstart their project and communicate it to others.

With this problem in mind, our goal is to create an app that produces UML diagrams from a user input that describes their planned design. Other than generating the diagram, the app can assist the users with any questions regarding the resulting UML diagram. 

With the cutting-edge AI technology provided in the OpenAI Assistants API, users can make use of its capabilities to generate accurate UML diagrams swiftly and fix them as needed without ever having to learn how to create them. Additionally, they could inquire about any confusions they may have regarding the final result to the app itself. 

The primary features of our application include automated UML diagram generation from natural language inputs and interactive feedback and assistance with the diagrams. Outside of simply creating the diagrams from a description, the app needs to provide a method for users to understand the final result, which is why we will include interactive feedback and assistance to either fix it or respond to any confusions regarding it. 

As a stretch goal, we plan on providing a social media platform for users to share their UML diagrams with other potentially interested users. Through this, motivated but inexperienced project leads can communicate their technological ideas to aspiring developers or even investors and collaborate to create endless possibilities. The platform allows for everyone, both familiar and unfamiliar with programming environments, to not only generate a visual to communicate their ideas but also share them with the community for any potential investors and developers. 

Ultimately, we hope to create an easy entry for non tech savvy individuals to be able to share their project ideas to developers and make their imaginations come true. Additionally, even experienced developers can create UML diagrams without the need to invest a significant amount of time. Our priority for the next seven weeks will be to perfect this app and increase involvement in the community, creating more possibilities for years to come.
