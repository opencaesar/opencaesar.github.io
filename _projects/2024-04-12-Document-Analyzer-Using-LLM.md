## Project Summary

This project intends to develop an approach to transform information icontained n (PDF) documents to a semantic Knowledge Graph (KG) conforming to an domain vocabulary (ontology) such that it can be queried. The envisioned approach is to develop an LLM-based assistant to perform this transformation.

## Results

We are proud to report that the team has won an award from JPL for this project.
