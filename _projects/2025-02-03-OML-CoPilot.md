## Project Summary

This project intends to develop an [OML](https://www.opencaesar.io/oml/)(Ontological Modeling Language) CoPilot, which is an AI Assistant that can help OML modelers create, edit, and analyze OML ontologies based on a given modeling method. The CoPilot will present a standalone chatting interface as well being integrated as a VS Code extension that has workspace awareness (i.e., can pull extra context from the workspace).

One of the modeling methods that will be used to test the approach is based on the [F Prime Prime](https://github.com/nasa/fpp) method.
