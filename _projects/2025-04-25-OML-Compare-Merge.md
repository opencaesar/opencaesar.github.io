## Project Summary

OML Compare & Merge is a lightweight, model-driven service that enables precise comparison and merging of ontologies authored in the [Ontological Modeling Language (OML)](https://www.opencaesar.io/oml/). Built on top of the [EMF Compare](https://eclipse.dev/emf/compare/) framework, it provides semantic-aware differencing and merging capabilities tailored to the structure and logic of OML ontologies. It will be deployed as both a Java CLI and a web service with web UI.

This project empowers systems engineers and knowledge modelers to manage ontology evolution, resolve conflicts, and maintain consistency across modular OML models. Designed for integration within the openCAESAR ecosystem, it supports rigorous, collaborative development of ontologies used in model-based systems engineering.
