## Project Summary

OML Compare & Merge will be a service that enables precise comparison and merging of ontologies authored in the [Ontological Modeling Language (OML)](https://www.opencaesar.io/oml/). It will leverage [EMF Compare](https://eclipse.dev/emf/compare/) framework, and Generative AI, to provide semantic-aware differencing and merging capabilities for OML tailored to the methodology used. It will be deployed as both a Java CLI and a web service  (standalone or integrated with OML workbenches).

This project empowers systems engineers and knowledge modelers to manage ontology evolution, resolve conflicts, and maintain consistency across modular OML models. Designed for integration within the openCAESAR ecosystem, it supports rigorous, collaborative development of ontologies used in model-based systems engineering.
