## Project Summary

This project is a case study that aims to develop a methodology for functional decomposition for systems using models. We look at FireSAT, an example mission that describes the development process for a satellite that detects wild fires on earth. This case study focuses on three top level functions from the FireSat mission: "Collect and Downlink Observation Data", "Control Attitude", and "Provide Electrical Power". We develop an approach to model functional decomposition, i.e. modeling the functions that are performed by some components along with their inputs, outputs and invocations of other functions. These models are described in the Ontological Modeling Language (OML) using the openCAESAR tools. Our result is the functional model itself and a set of queries to analyze it.
