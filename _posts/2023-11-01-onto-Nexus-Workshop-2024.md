## Hybrid Event

The [openCAESAR](https://www.opencaesar.io/) team is hosting a one-day event named <b>onto:Nexus 2024 : The 1st Workshop on Ontological Modeling and Analysis</b> at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ([JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/)) in Pasadena, CA on Wed Jan 31st, 2024. CA. The physical address is 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91011.

The theme of the workshop will be <b>Infusing Rigor and Agility in MBSE</b>. An introductory talk with this title will be given by Maged Elaasar at the [INCOSE IW 2024](https://www.incose.org/IW2024), which will take place on Jan 27-30 in the close-by area of Torrance, CA. This talk is scheduled on Sat 1/27 at 3:30 PM.

The <b>onto:Nexus 2024 workshop</b> is free hybrid event (no registration fees) but requires advance registration for in-person attendance as the JPL venue space is limited and the onboarding process for JPL visitor takes some time. If you are interested in attending, please send your interest by IM or email to [Maged Elaasar](mailto:elaasar@jpl.nasa.gov) a.s.a.p. and wait for a confirmation. Registration is also required for online attendance (which will be on the *MS Teams* platform) but the deadline will be closer to the event.

## Pre-Event Questionnaire

A link to a pre-event questionnaire will be avialable soon. It will include questions that are meant to poll the community for their experiences, interests, and expectations. A summary of the answers will be presented in the introductory talk of the workshop.

## Community Presentations

One of the main objectives of the workshop is to build a community for rigorous and agile MBSE. This is why the agenda includes a 1h 30m session for members of the community to present their context, interests, and plans. Since we want to accomodate as many such presentations as possible, they have to be short (10 mins) so we recommend 2-3 slides only. <b>If you like to present in this slot, we ask you to send [Maged Elaasar](mailto:elaasar@jpl.nasa.gov) an abstract of your talk and wait for a confirmation</b>. You can then send the slides (max by Jan 26), which will be merged into a single deck to minimize the hand off time between presenters.

## Panel: How Should we Collaborate?

The agenda includes a 1h panel session that will discuss how the community should collaborate to achive synnergy and move faster in this field. Questions will be posed on what to collaborate on and how to get organized to achieve them.

## JPL Campus Tour

The agenda has a 45 mins slot for a JPL campus tour for in-person attendees. (We will try to have a concurrent virtual tour for online attendees.)

## Breaks

A few breaks are planned in the agenda. Coffee will be provided by JPL. However, lunch will be the responsibility of attendees (can be brought or purchased from the JPL cafeteria during lunch break).
