The [openCAESAR](https://www.opencaesar.io/) team is hosting a one-day event named <b>onto:Nexus 2024 : The 1st Forum on Ontological Modeling and Analysis</b> at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ([JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/)) in Pasadena, CA on Wed Jan 31st, 2024. CA. The physical address is 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91011.

The theme of the forum will be <b>Infusing Rigor and Agility in MBSE</b>. A talk about the openCAESAR approach to this will be given by Maged Elaasar at the [INCOSE IW 2024](https://www.incose.org/IW2024), which will take place on Jan 27-30 in the close-by area of Torrance, CA. This talk is scheduled on Sat 1/27 at 3:30 PM.

The <b>onto:Nexus 2024 forum</b> is free hybrid event (no registration fees) but requires advance registration for in-person attendance as the JPL venue space is limited and the onboarding process for JPL visitor takes some time. If you are interested in attending, please send your interest by IM or email to [Maged Elaasar](mailto:elaasar@jpl.nasa.gov) a.s.a.p. and wait for a confirmation. Registration is also required for online attendance (which will be on the *MS Teams* platform) but the deadline will be closer to the event.
