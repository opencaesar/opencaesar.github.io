## Abstract

Maged Elaasar will introduce the openCAESAR project and its approach to MBSE. It will highlight how the approach increases the rigor of systems description using the Ontological Modeling Language (OML) and other semantic technologies, and increases the agility of systems engineering workflows by using DevOps practices. It will also reflect on experience using this approach for several years on large space projects (Like Psyche, Europa Clipper, and Mars Sample Return) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Towards the end, the talk will also introduce onto:Nexus 2024, a one-day hybrid forum planned on Wed 1/31 (the day after IW) at JPL. The forum on Ontological Modeling and Analysis will be an opportunity to learn more about openCAESAR and the work of other members of its community.

<h2>Maged Elaasar</h2> is a Senior Technology Researcher at NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)) at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). He technically leads the Integrated Model Centric Engineering (IMCE) program, which develops the openCAESAR project, which is a technology to transform systems engineering into a rigorous, agile, and data-centric practice. openCAESAR is being used by several space missions at JPL. Maged also leads Autonomica, an R&D project that uses  openCAESAR to support architecting, implementing, and testing autonomous systems. Prior to that, Maged was a technical leader at IBM where he led the R&D of various software and systems modeling technologies. Maged is also the founder of Modelware Solutions, which is a firm that provides consulting and training services in the area of MBSE. Maged is also a lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He is also a lecturer in the Multidisciplinary Graduate Engineering Program at Northeastern University (NEU). He is also a research partner to numerous research labs around the world. His research interests span model-based systems engineering, model-driven software engineering, semantic web, analytics, cloud computing, and autonomy.
