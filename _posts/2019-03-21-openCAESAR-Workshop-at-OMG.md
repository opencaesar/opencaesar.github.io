# Abstract

This workshop will introduce NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPL's) openCAESAR Project and its ontological approach to systems modeling and analysis. It will focus on the Ontological Modeling Language (OML), its authoring and analysis tools and its workflows. It will provide the background and motivation for developing the approach at the JPL and its adoption by several space projects. In addition, a case study will be presented and used to demonstrate the approach and motivate discussion.
