## About Me

Aaron Levitt works on the Systems Modeling Methodology group at NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology.  He currently works on the CAESAR (Computer Aided Engineering for System ARchitecture) project as a full-stack software engineer which aims to develop model-centric methodology and tooling with the help of the Semantic Web and the development of ontologies and vocabularies that fit JPL's missions.  CAESAR's goal is to transform system engineering on JPL missions into a more rigorous, agile, and information-centric practice.  Prior to working on CAESAR, he worked as an electrical engineer on NASA's Lucy spacecraft doing V&V (Verification and Validation) and as an EGSE (Electrical Ground Support Equipment) software engineer writing scripts for I&T (Integration and Test).
