## Abstract

As the engineering of Digital Twins (DTs) involves the domain knowledge of experts, an exciting research direction is to capture and reason about this knowledge using ontologies. This talk will discuss ongoing work applying ontological modeling and the openCAESAR framework to the engineering of DTs and their services. The first topic is enhancing the reporting of DTs in the DevOps cycle by automatically producing textual and graphical reports from an ontologically-based DT. The second topic is on explicitly modelling the processes/workflows for the engineering of DTs in ontologies. This allows for tool-assisted user guidance throughout the DT engineering activity.
