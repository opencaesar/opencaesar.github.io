## Abstract

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) is a versatile conglomerate with operations spanning multiple industries including aerospace, defense, energy and environment plants, logistics, and more. In our effort to enhance the systems engineering capabilities across our organization, we are currently developing a business process that integrates MBSE. We will be presenting our strategy for implementing MBSE throughout the company and sharing examples from the commercial aviation and rocket sectors. These examples will highlight the ontological modeling of system requirements and architectures, as well as the seamless integration between MBSE and analysis.
