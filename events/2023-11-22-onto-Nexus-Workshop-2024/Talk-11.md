## Abstract

The Digital Engineering Framework for Integration and Interoperability (DEFII) provides a framework for using ontology-aligned data in a Digital Engineering context. This presentation will outline the framework, including the different approaches for interacting with ontology-aligned data. It will also briefly discuss how this approach to knowledge representation can yield insight in multi-domain engineering design and analysis, including approaches to model verification and digital thread representation.
