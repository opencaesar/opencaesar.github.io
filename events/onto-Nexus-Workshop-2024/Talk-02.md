<h2><a href="mailto:david.a.wagner@jpl.nasa.gov">David Wagner</a></h2> supervises the Systems Modeling Methodology group at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). He is also the technical manager for the CAESAR development project that is central to JPL’s Integrated Model-Centric Engineering program. The CAESAR project specifically aims to develop model-centric methodology and tooling to transform the system engineering of JPL missions into a rigorous, agile, and information-centric practice. Prior to working on CAESAR, he served as a model architect and project system engineer on the Europa Clipper project. And prior to that he has extensive experience architecting and developing flight- and ground-based software systems supporting robotic space missions at JPL.
