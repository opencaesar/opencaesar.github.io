## Abstract

This presentation summarizes an ambitious project developing a suite of ontologies and other knowledge organization systems for spaceflight and broader space domains: https://purl.org/space ontology. A set of conceptual, semantic and ontological models are being developed covering topics such as orbitology, spacecraft and their subsystems, space standards, policy & law, space situational awareness and traffic management. An example is a family of ontologies about the CCSDS Navigation Data Messages. Spaceflight events, such as collisions and proximity operations, are example target scenarios for ontological analysis, development, and application. This is, in part, aimed to support space domain awareness and decision-making. Various development tools and knowledge representation languages are being explored, including but not limited to OML, to computationally implement the conceptualizations of the models. The use of symbolic logic, e.g., first-order predicate calculus (FOL), is part of the project methodology, presenting an opportunity for partnerships with industry or academia developers of what is a well-known gap in user-friendly, GUI-based tools capable of reasoning with FOL.

<h2><a href="mailto:ontologos@yahoo.com">Robert Rovetto</a></h2> is an independent researcher interested in conceptual modeling; foundational ontology; ontology for space; ontology for maritime safety; philosophy; highly abstract concepts in ontology; and the ethics of ontology. He innovates and ideates, bringing unsurpassed attention to detail, abstraction, and domain expertise to achieve mission success. Robert has been part of CCSDS, AIAA, IAF, ISO, the NASA Datanauts, and ontology committees for a number of years. Output has included single and co- authored agency technical documents, national & international standards, and journal and conference articles. With a portfolio of various multidisciplinary projects open to collaboration, Robert creates knowledge organization systems, develops fine conceptual distinctions, and produces concept frameworks. Drawing on active participation in the global community since 2010, he brings a unique big- picture and focused perspective. Open to employment, PhD opportunities, and sponsors to realize the vision of one of his prolific projects, interested readers should make contact.
