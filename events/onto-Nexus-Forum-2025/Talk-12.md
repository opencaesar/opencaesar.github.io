## Abstract

Flexo MMS is an RDF-based model management service, or “GitHub for graphs”. The Flexo architecture defines a broader, modular system of web-friendly micro-services built to meet domain-specific needs. In this talk, we’ll review the Flexo SysML v2 web services module, currently under development at OpenMBEE, and how it fits into and benefits from the broader Flexo ecosystem.
