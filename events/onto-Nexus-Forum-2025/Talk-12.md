## Abstract

Flexo MMS is an RDF-based model management service, or “GitHub for graphs”. The Flexo architecture defines a broader, modular system of web-friendly micro-services built to meet domain-specific needs. In this talk, we’ll review the Flexo SysML v2 web services module, currently under development at OpenMBEE, and how it fits into and benefits from the broader Flexo ecosystem.

<h2><a href="mailto:christopher.l.delp@jpl.nasa.gov">Christopher Delp</a></h2> is an industry-recognized leader in Digital Engineering, Model-Based Systems Engineering/Model-Based Engineering, Systems Modeling, Systems Architecture, and Open Source for Systems Engineering. He has played significant leadership roles in moving JPL towards MBSE and Digital Engineering. In professional circles, he leads the INCOSE Model-Based Environments workshop with a focus on Open-Source Modeling for Systems Engineering. He also co-founded the OpenMBEE open-source project. With a diverse background in Systems Engineering and Software Engineering on JPL Flight Projects spanning more than 25 years of experience, his expertise encompasses System Architecture and Design, developing and testing safety-critical software, and applying Systems Engineering principles throughout the project lifecycle. He is esteemed as an industry-leading authority in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and Model-Based Engineering Environments. He is the Technical Group Supervisor for Systems Product Solutions Engineering, a group dedicated to implementing digital engineering methodologies for the creation of robust software environments designed to deliver advanced digital engineering solutions.  Highlighting significant contributions in previous roles, he led a multi-year effort rearchitecting the Model-Based Engineering Enterprise for Systems and Software Engineering in JPLs Computer Aided Engineering program. This effort is at the forefront of engineering innovation, providing a state-of-the-art environment for system modeling, analytical assessments, and simulation development grounded in Open Engineering principles. He spearheaded the Model Environment Development for the Europa Clipper mission, establishing a Model-Based Engineering Environment and fostering the growth of the Open MBEE community—a collective focused on open-source Model-Based Engineering models, software, and frameworks. He is one of the founding members of the OpenMBEE project. This is a First-of-a-Kind Open-Source project focused on Digital Engineering using a Model-Based Engineering Environment built around the Dragon Architecture. SysML standards contributions are another area of industry leadership to which he regularly contributes. He is a leading member of the SysML standards development team at OMG and INCOSE and also leads the OpenMBEE workshop at INCOSE. He holds a Master's in Systems Engineering from the University of Arizona.
