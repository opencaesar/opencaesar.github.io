## Abstract

This talks will introduce ongoing effort by the Flexo SysML v2 Team to develop an OWL2-DL ontology for SysML v2, the next generation systems modeling language. The primary goal is to enable RDF representation of SysML v2 models, facilitating improved interoperability and the creation of tools like Flexo MMS that can manage these models in an RDF triple store. The presentation outlines the value proposition of using an OWL ontology, the openCAESAR framework and OML used in its creation pipeline, key aspects of the generated SysML vocabulary, and transformation decisions made during the process. It also discusses current challenges and future steps towards refining and validating the ontology for broader adoption within the SysML community.

<h2><a href="mailto:elaasar@jpl.nasa.gov">Maged Elaasar</a></h2> is a Senior Technology Researcher at NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)) at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). He technically leads the Integrated Model Centric Engineering (IMCE) program, which develops the openCAESAR project, which is a technology to transform systems engineering into a rigorous, agile, and data-centric practice. openCAESAR is being used by several space missions at JPL. Maged also leads Autonomica, an R&D project that uses  openCAESAR to support architecting, implementing, and testing autonomous systems. Prior to that, Maged was a technical leader at IBM where he led the R&D of various software and systems modeling technologies. Maged is also the founder of Modelware Solutions, which is a firm that provides consulting and training services in the area of MBSE. Maged is also a lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He is also a lecturer in the Multidisciplinary Graduate Engineering Program at Northeastern University (NEU). He is also a research partner to numerous research labs around the world. His research interests span model-based systems engineering, model-driven software engineering, semantic web, analytics, cloud computing, and autonomy.
