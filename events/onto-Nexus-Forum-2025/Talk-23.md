## Abstract

This tutorial will be an introduction to modeling with the Ontological Modeling Language (OML) using the openCAESAR tools. I will start by giving a brief background about the language, its syntax, semantics, and use cases. Then, I will show how to use it to do vocabulary modeling for a simple systems engineering methdology. Then, I will show how to use it to model and analyze a system based on that methodology. The analysis will feature logical reasoning and SPARQL queries. Finally, I will show how to produce reports and setup a repository with CI/CD scripts.

<h2><a href="mailto:elaasar@jpl.nasa.gov">Maged Elaasar</a></h2> is a Senior Technology Researcher at NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)) at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). He technically leads the Integrated Model Centric Engineering (IMCE) program, which develops the openCAESAR project, which is a technology to transform systems engineering into a rigorous, agile, and data-centric practice. openCAESAR is being used by several space missions at JPL. Maged also leads Autonomica, an R&D project that uses  openCAESAR to support architecting, implementing, and testing autonomous systems. Prior to that, Maged was a technical leader at IBM where he led the R&D of various software and systems modeling technologies. Maged is also the founder of Modelware Solutions, which is a firm that provides consulting and training services in the area of MBSE. Maged is also a lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He is also a lecturer in the Multidisciplinary Graduate Engineering Program at Northeastern University (NEU). He is also a research partner to numerous research labs around the world. His research interests span model-based systems engineering, model-driven software engineering, semantic web, analytics, cloud computing, and autonomy.
