## Abstract

Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) improves systems engineering by using models as the primary means for domain modeling, information exchange, and improving collaboration across disciplines. While MBSE offers numerous benefits, little is known on how it is supported in different organizations, which limits the ability to fully capitalize on the potential of MBSE across industries. To bridge this gap, in this presentation, we report on a survey study that we conducted with over 70 practitioners from various industries including the space industry, defense, automotive, and aviation to assess the current state of MBSE practice. The suvey was conducted in the context of the first edition of the onto:Nexus forum. It included a comprehensive questionnaire designed to explore adoption levels, method adaptation to different organizational structures, tool adaptation, and collaboration challenges. In addition, the study examined how MBSE models are managed, including aspects such as visibility, progress reviews, change management, and modular model organization. We share our findings and propose strategies to enhance the MBSE practice in industry, highlighting the importance of an MBSE ecosystem that integrates agility, rigor, and intelligence.
