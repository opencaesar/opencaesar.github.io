## Abstract

This presentation will explore how the Obsidian environment can serve as a powerful, user-friendly authoring tool for OML ontologies. We’ll begin by examining the OML adapter, which automatically synthesizes Obsidian metadata from ontological vocabularies. This synthesized metadata provides a robust starting point for developing methodology-based authoring viewpoints in Obsidian. We’ll then highlight how Obsidian can streamline and enhance the creation of ontological models—offering greater usability, agility, and productivity—while preserving the rigor necessary for effective ontology engineering.

<h2><a href="mailto:elaasar@jpl.nasa.gov">Maged Elaasar</a></h2> is a Senior Technology Researcher at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)) at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). He technically leads the Integrated Model Centric Engineering (IMCE) program, which develops the openCAESAR project, which is a technology to transform systems engineering into a rigorous, agile, and data-centric practice. openCAESAR is being used by several space missions at JPL. Maged also leads Autonomica, an R&D project that uses  openCAESAR to support architecting, implementing, and testing autonomous systems. Prior to that, Maged was a technical leader at IBM where he led the R&D of various software and systems modeling technologies. Maged is also the founder of Modelware Solutions, which is a firm that provides consulting and training services in the area of MBSE. Maged is also a lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He is also a lecturer in the Multidisciplinary Graduate Engineering Program at Northeastern University (NEU). He is also a research partner to numerous research labs around the world. His research interests span model-based systems engineering, model-driven software engineering, semantic web, analytics, cloud computing, and autonomy.
