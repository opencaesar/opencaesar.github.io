## Abstract

In this talk, we will present an idea for integrating ontological modeling and mathematical analysis using OML and OML-Vision as analysis workflow orchestration tools.
We apply the proposed approach to automate analysis workflows across multiple domains to improve the rigor and agility of JAXA's mission concept study process.
In addition, we will share the current activities of JAXA's R&D efforts leveraging openCAESAR.

<h2><a href="mailto:nakajima.yuta@jaxa.jp">Yuta Nakajima</a></h2> is a Flight Project Systems Engineer of Engineering Test Satellite 9 project at JAXA. His expertise lies in the development of cutting-edge electric propulsion systems, specifically the 6kW Hall thruster system designed for 5-ton class satellites. In this role, he is responsible for the development of the 6kW power processing unit and integration test of hall thruster, flow controller and power processing unit. He also served as a MBSE practitioner applying MBSE to explore and solve business questions in actual flight project.
He joined the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) in 2009 as GNC engineer in the Small Demonstration Satellite-4(SDS-4) project. After successful launch and operations of SDS-4, he served as a system engineer at Systems Technology Unit to conduct Pre-Phase A and Phase A study of JAXAâ€™s future missions.
